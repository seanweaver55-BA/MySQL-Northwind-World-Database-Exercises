# SQL Practice Projects – Northwind & World Databases

This repository contains a series of SQL exercises I completed using **MySQL Workbench** on the classic **Northwind** and **World** sample databases.  
The aim of these tasks is to simulate real-world business scenarios and data analysis problems commonly faced by analysts.
